Speedway
Leonardo is a professional runner who participates in several athletics championships around the world. The size of tracks around the world is not standardized. That's why Leonardo, who trains at a club that has a circular track, decided to set his training at C meters, instead of a fixed number of laps on the track. After each training session, Leonardo must drink half a liter of water before making any effort, and that is why he wants to leave his water bottle exactly at the point on the track where he ends his training.

Knowing the length of the race track that Leonardo intends to train, he decided to ask for your help in calculating the location of the training end point. The end point is the place on the track where he ends the C-meter course, considering that he starts from the starting point and always moves in the same direction. The end point is given by the number of meters between the starting point and the place where Leonardo ends his training, counted in the direction of the course. Leonardo wants to leave his water bottle at this point.

For example, if the track is 12 meters and Leonardo has set his training at 22 meters, the end point is 10.

His task is, given the number C of meters that Leonardo intends to run and the length N in meters of the circular track, to determine the end point of his training.

Input
The input consists of just one line containing two integers C and N that indicate, respectively, the number of meters Leonardo intends to run and the length of the track.

Exit
His program should print only one line, containing only one integer, indicating the end point of Leonardo's training.

restrictions
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ C ≤ 10⁸
